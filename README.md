OctoCath the newbie recently learned to greet the world in C thanks to Harvard's CS50 class!

CS50 2017 Week 1:
Hello.c; http://docs.cs50.net/problems/hello/hello.html

This is also her first repository on Github. :) 
And CS50 and the C programming language is her first formal and hands-on exposure to computer science/programming!!

*OctoCath is twirling around with excitement!!!!*
